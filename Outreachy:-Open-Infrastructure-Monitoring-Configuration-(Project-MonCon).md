## Project description

This project involves improvements to how we monitor the machines at the open source project.  It involves assessment and configuration of the Nagios server at the project.  

Nagios is a configurable server monitoring tool, monitoring elements such as connectivity, memory & cpu usage, disk space usage, system daemons etc. It consists of a monitoring server with agents on each remote host to be monitored. The aim of this project is to automate the Nagios server side configuration, by utilising  a script/scripts to handle the creation, and manipulation of the server side configuration files. In addition the creation of a tool to validate and report errors in those files.
