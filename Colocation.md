### Remote Access

The firewalls are accessible via our bastion host ([use it as a SOCKS proxy](https://ma.ttias.be/socks-proxy-linux-ssh-bypass-content-filters/)) or internally via VPN. 

### Network Setup

The uplink is configured with active/passive high-availability over two perimeter networks (1 and 2, see below). 1 is the active, 2 the passive link. If one link goes down, traffic flows over the other link.

#### Perimeter Network 1

5.148.175.184/30  
Uplink IP: 5.148.175.185  
Our (gateway/firewall) IP: 5.148.175.186

2a02:418:39aa:2::/64  
Uplink IP: 2a02:418:39aa:2::1  
Our (gateway/firewall) IP: 2a02:418:39aa:2::2

#### Perimeter Network 2

5.148.175.188/30  
Uplink IP: 5.148.175.189  
Our (gateway/firewall) IP: 5.148.175.190

2a02:418:39aa:7::1/64  
Uplink IP: 2a02:418:39aa:2::1  
Our (gateway/firewall) IP: 2a02:418:39aa:7::2

#### Public IP Ranges

5.148.170.144/28  
2a02:418:3001::/48

#### Management Network

x.1 CARP
x.2 Firewall 01
x.3 Firewall 02
x.4 Switch
x.5 KVM switch 01
```

### VPN

VPN is required to manage or access servers and other equipments. We use OpenVPN (SSL/TLS + User Auth with TOTP enabled) and have 3 different networks.

#### vpnstaff (port 1194)

Provides full access to all equipment except TCK infrastructure. For TCK infrastructure, only access to lights-out management is provided. Limited to AdoptOpenJDK infrastructure team.

#### vpnguest (port 1195)

Provides access to build and test networks (for debugging builds, tests, ...).

#### vpntck (port 1196)

Provides access to TCK infrastructure. **Limited to EMO staff and people that have signed a three-way OCTLA with Eclipse and Oracle**.

### Notes

VPN:

* OpenVPN was chosen because it's the most flexible and recommended option for OPNSense (Jan 2021).
* We have one OpenVPN instance per user group because (again) it's the most flexible option we found during the setup (Jan 2021). The approach outlined in the [official How To Guide](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#configuring-client-specific-rules-and-access-policies) works with client-specific rules. Those rules are specific for a single client, require a separate network per user, and therefore do not scale with a larger number of users.
