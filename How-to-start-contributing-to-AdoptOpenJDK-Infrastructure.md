# Why would I want to?

The intention of AdoptOpenJDK is to provide binaries and hardware access for all of the major platforms, for the purposes of...

- Allowing end users to have a reliable source of OpenJDK binaries for all platforms.
- Research and Development by OpenJDK developers, academics and researchers.
- An open, common, audited, build infrastructure for vendors to use (if they wish).
- Providing a place to try out build infrastructure ideas that might one day be re-implemented in the OpenJDK project.

To achieve this, we need people to help us maintain the infrastructure, tools and systems we use and rely on. If this is something you'd like to get involed with, this document provides an overview of how to get started.

Please start by read the the [AdoptOpenJDK Infrastructure Onboarding Guide](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/master/ONBOARDING.md) in the AdoptOpenJDK Infrastructure repository at github.com.
